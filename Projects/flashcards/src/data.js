    question: "What is Machine Learning?",
    answer: "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit programming.",
    additional_info: "It involves the use of data to train models and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for the task.",

    question: "What are the three main types of Machine Learning?",
    answer: "The three main types of Machine Learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.",
    additional_info: "Supervised learning involves learning a mapping from input-output pairs. Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns or structures in data. Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make sequences of decisions to maximize a reward signal.",

    question: "Can you give an example of supervised learning?",
    answer: "Image classification is an example of supervised learning. The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each image is associated with a specific label (e.g., cat or dog). The model learns to predict labels for new, unseen images.",
    additional_info: "Other examples include spam email detection, language translation, and predicting stock prices.",

    question: "What is the purpose of unsupervised learning?",
    answer: "Unsupervised learning is used to find hidden patterns or structures in data without labeled outputs. It includes tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.",
    additional_info: "Clustering involves grouping similar data points together, while dimensionality reduction aims to reduce the number of features while preserving important information.",

    question: "Explain reinforcement learning.",
    answer: "Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward signal. The agent learns by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.",
    additional_info: "Applications include game playing, robotic control, and autonomous vehicles.",

    question: "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
    answer: "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.",
    additional_info: "Regularization techniques, cross-validation, and increasing the size of the dataset are common methods to prevent overfitting.",

    question: "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
    answer: "Supervised learning involves learning from labeled data with input-output pairs, while unsupervised learning involves finding patterns or structures in unlabeled data.",
    additional_info: "In supervised learning, the model aims to learn a mapping from input to output, while in unsupervised learning, the focus is on discovering the underlying structure or relationships within the data.",

    question: "What is a neural network in the context of machine learning?",
    answer: "A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.",
    additional_info: "Neural networks are used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and complex pattern recognition.",

    question: "What is the bias-variance trade-off?",
    answer: "The bias-variance tradeoff is a key concept in machine learning. It represents a balance between a model's ability to capture the underlying patterns in data (low bias) and its sensitivity to fluctuations or noise in the training data (low variance).",
    additional_info: "Finding the right balance is crucial to building models that generalize well to new, unseen data.",

    question: "What is a decision tree in machine learning?",
    answer: "A decision tree is a tree-like model that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It recursively splits the dataset based on the most significant features, creating a tree structure of decision rules.",
    additional_info: "Decision trees are interpretable and can be visualized, making them useful for understanding the decision-making process of a model.",
